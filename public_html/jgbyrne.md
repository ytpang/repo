## i. Interest of content

**Good**

The content was quite interesting. I thought the section on how computers can improve access to Education was particuarly interesting. The content spanned an impressively wide range of topics and subtopics.

## ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation

**Weak**

There is no consistency between pages. The background image on the homepage and the colour choice on the entertainment page make for a poor reading experience. Some pages employ webfonts well, but others do not. The site is mostly designed responsively and adapts to different window sizes in a reasonable manner. Images are chosen reasonably. No pages employ a navbar or menu which, if used, would improve the usability of the site.

## iii. Quality of written presentation

**Acceptable**

Articles are reasonably structured and of a good length. The tone is well chosen for this type of website. The use of a timeline on the education page is a nice editorial choice. There are a substantial number of grammatical errors and some spelling mistakes.

## iv. Validity of HTML

**Weak**

All pages have validation issues. The education page is the most valid page, while the healthcare page is perhaps the weakest. Common issues include the absence of a valid DOCTYPE comment and bad div ids.

## v. Evidence of collaboration

**Weak**

There are no author bios. All members wrote significant, well considered articles. However, there is no consistency between any of the pages - each has clearly been written in the author's own idiomatic style using their own preferred tools. A shared stylesheet would go a long way towards improving the usability and professionalism of this website.
