Interest of content
*******************

Rating: Excellent

The "Entertainment" page focuses more on the present/cutting edge of computing, whilst the "Education" page provides a historical insight into the advancements leading up to the modern day. This makes for an interesting read.
The index page ties the other pages together by providing a concise summary and a hyperlink to each section.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation
**********************************************

Rating: Very Good

The chosen colour schemes and fonts for each page make for easy-to-read content. The "education" page uses a non-default font which also makes it easier to read. The use of images is also good.

Quality of written presentation
*******************************

Rating: Sound

Some pages have a few minor spelling mistakes (e.g. "Comouter" instead of "Computer"), but otherwise the written communication is sufficient to convey the intended information to the reader.

Validity of HTML
****************

Rating: Exemplary

HTML is consistently valid, with each opening tag having a closing tag where appropriate. All hyperlinks and images are included successfully.

Evidence of Collaboration
*************************

Rating: Good

There is no author info section, however there appears to be a balanced contribution for all the collaborators.
